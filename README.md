# arch-install

My personal set of scripts for Arch Linux installation.

> THESE SCRIPTS ARE NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLIC OUT-OF-THE-BOX USE!
>
> They are intended for my LEGACY BIOS, AMD GPU and AMD CPU setup.
>
> You are free to utilize any of the scripts, any specific part of them, too. They are built following the official docs and my needs, nothing extraordinal
